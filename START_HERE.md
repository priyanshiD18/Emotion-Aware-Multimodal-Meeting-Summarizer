## 🔧 Configuration Guide

Edit `config.env` for:

### Model Selection
```env
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v2  # Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2
```
- **tiny/base**: Fast but less accurate
- **small/medium**: Good balance
- **large**: Best accuracy, slower

### LLM Provider
```env
LLM_PROVIDER=openai     # Options: openai, google
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

### Processing Options
```env
MAX_AUDIO_LENGTH_MINUTES=120
SAMPLE_RATE=16000
```

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Processing Speed
- **10-minute meeting**: 3-5 minutes on CPU, 1-2 minutes on GPU
- **30-minute meeting**: 10-15 minutes on CPU, 3-5 minutes on GPU
- **60-minute meeting**: 20-30 minutes on CPU, 6-10 minutes on GPU

### Accuracy
- **Transcription**: 90-95% accuracy (clean audio)
- **Speaker ID**: 85-90% accuracy
- **Emotion**: 75-80% accuracy

### Resource Usage
- **RAM**: 4-8GB during processing
- **Disk**: 5GB for models + 1MB per minute of audio
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores recommended
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended (5-10x speedup)

---

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need a GPU?
**A:** No, but it's 5-10x faster with GPU. CPU works fine for occasional use.

### Q: What audio quality do I need?
**A:** Any quality works, but clear audio (minimal background noise) gives best results.

### Q: Can I process live meetings?
**A:** Currently supports uploaded recordings. Real-time streaming is a planned feature.

### Q: What about privacy?
**A:** Audio is processed locally. Only text is sent to LLM APIs. You control your data.

### Q: Can I use it offline?
**A:** Transcription & emotion work offline. Agent analysis requires LLM API (internet).

### Q: How much does it cost to run?
**A:** Main cost is LLM API usage. ~$0.10-0.30 per hour of meeting (GPT-4 pricing).

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Models won't download?
- Check HuggingFace token
- Accept model licenses
- Check internet connection

### API not responding?
- Verify config.env has API keys
- Check `docker-compose logs -f api`
- Try `curl http://localhost:8000/health`

### Poor transcription?
- Check audio quality
- Try different Whisper model
- Ensure correct language

### Speaker confusion?
- Specify number of speakers manually
- Ensure speakers don't overlap too much
